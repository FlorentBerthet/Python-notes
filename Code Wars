# Convert string to camel case

Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing.
The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case,
also often referred to as Pascal case).

to_camel_case("The_Stealth_Warrior") # returns "TheStealthWarrior"

#Pete the baker

'''
Pete likes to bake some cakes. He has some recipes and ingredients. Unfortunately he is not good in maths.
Can you help him to find out, how many cakes he could bake considering his recipes?

Write a function cakes(), which takes the recipe (object) and the available ingredients (also an object)
and returns the maximum number of cakes Pete can bake (integer).
For simplicity there are no units for the amounts (e.g. 1 lb of flour or 200 g of sugar are simply 1 or 200).
Ingredients that are not present in the objects, can be considered as 0.

Examples:

# must return 2
cakes({flour: 500, sugar: 200, eggs: 1}, {flour: 1200, sugar: 1200, eggs: 5, milk: 200})
# must return 0
cakes({apples: 3, flour: 300, sugar: 150, milk: 100, oil: 100}, {sugar: 500, flour: 2000, milk: 2000})
'''
def cakes(recipe, available):
    cakes_per_item={}
    for item in recipe:
        if item in available:
            cakes_per_item.update({item: available[item]//recipe[item]})
        else:
            cakes_per_item[item] = 0
    max_cakes=min(cakes_per_item.values())

# Bit Counting

'''
Write a function that takes an integer as input, and returns the number of bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number. You can guarantee that input is non-negative.

Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case

'''

# Scramblies

'''
Complete the function scramble(str1, str2) that returns true if a portion of str1 characters can be rearranged to match str2, otherwise returns false.

Notes:

Only lower case letters will be used (a-z). No punctuation or digits will be included.
Performance needs to be considered

Examples
scramble('rkqodlw', 'world') ==> True
scramble('cedewaraaossoqqyt', 'codewars') ==> True
