### Frequency of each character in String

'''
Using collections.Counter()
The most suggested method that could be used to find all occurrences is this method,
this actually gets all element frequency and could also be used to print single element frequency if required.
'''

from collections import Counter 

test_str = "GeeksforGeeks"
res = Counter(test_str)

'''
Using dict.get()

get() method is used to check the previously occurring character in string, 
if its new, it assigns 0 as initial and appends 1 to it, 
else appends 1 to previously holded value of that element in dictionary.
